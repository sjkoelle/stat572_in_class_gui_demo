                   arbitrary finite graph G, or more generally on an arbitrary
                   matroid M, and encodes much important combinatorial
                   information about the graph (indeed, in the matroid case it
                   encodes the full structure of the matroid). It contains as a
                   special case the familiar two-variable Tutte polynomial --
                   and therefore also its one-variable specializations such as
                   the chromatic polynomial, the flow polynomial and the
                   reliability polynomial -- but is considerably more flexible.
                   I begin by giving an introduction to all these problems,
                   stressing the advantages of working with the multivariate
                   version. I then discuss some questions concerning the
                   complex zeros of the multivariate Tutte polynomial, along
                   with their physical interpretations in statistical mechanics
                   (in connection with the Yang--Lee approach to phase

                   relationship between its prediction performance and the

                   this paper, we give new insights into this relationship in
                   the context of multiple linear regression. We show, in
                   particular, that the incorporation of a simple correlation

                   and the Potts model. We give a relatively self-contained
                   introduction to Khovanov homology, and also a reformulation
                   of the Potts model in terms of a bracket state sum expansion
                   on a knot diagram K(G) related to a planar graph G via the

                   to the given order of the variables. Yet, successful
                   learning is often possible due to sparsity: the fact that
                   the data are typically redundant with underlying structures
                   that can be represented by only a few features. In this
                   paper we present treelets--a novel construction of
                   multi-scale bases that extends wavelets to nonsmooth
                   signals. The method is fully adaptive, as it returns a
                   hierarchical tree and an orthonormal basis which both
                   reflect the internal structure of the data. Treelets are
                   especially well-suited as a dimensionality reduction and
                   feature selection tool prior to regression and

                   Covariance selection aims at estimating those structural
                   zeros from data. We show that neighborhood selection with
                   the Lasso is a computationally attractive alternative to
                   standard covariance selection for sparse high-dimensional
                   graphs. Neighborhood selection estimates the conditional
                   independence restrictions separately for each node in the
                   graph and is hence equivalent to variable selection for
                   Gaussian linear models. We show that the proposed
                   neighborhood selection scheme is consistent for sparse
                   high-dimensional graphs. Consistency hinges on the choice of
                   the penalty parameter. The oracle value for optimal

                   larger than the number of samples $n$. However, it was
                   recently discovered that the sparsity pattern of the Lasso
                   estimator can only be asymptotically identical to the true
                   sparsity pattern if the design matrix satisfies the
                   so-called irrepresentable condition. The latter condition
                   can easily be violated in the presence of highly correlated
                   variables. Here we examine the behavior of the Lasso
                   estimators if the irrepresentable condition is relaxed. Even
                   though the Lasso cannot recover the correct sparsity

                   Furthermore, a rate of convergence result is obtained on the

              necessary condition for the lasso variable selection to be
              consistent. Consequently, there exist certain scenarios where the
              lasso is inconsistent for variable selection. We then propose a
              new version of the lasso, called the adaptive lasso, where
              adaptive weights are used for penalizing different coefficients
              in the ?1 penalty. We show that the adaptive lasso enjoys the
              oracle properties; namely, it performs as well as if the true
              underlying model were given in advance. Similar to the lasso, the
              adaptive lasso is shown to be near-minimax optimal. Furthermore,
              the adaptive lasso can be solved by the same efficient algorithm

                 invertebrate systems such as flies and worms. Such tools were
                 not available for genome manipulations in vertebrates until

                 transposon fossils found in fish genomes. This element, the
                 Sleeping Beauty transposon, shows efficient transposition in
                 cells of a wide range of vertebrates, including humans.
                 Sleeping Beauty transposition is a cut-and-paste process,
                 during which the element ``jumps'' from one DNA molecule to
                 another. Transposon integration into chromosomes provides the

                 considerable interest in developing efficient and safe vectors

                 assay for long-term repopulating stem cells with the potential
                 for reconstituting all hematopoietic lineages. This assay has
                 two key features. The first is the use of competitive
                 repopulation conditions that ensure not only the detection of
                 a very primitive class of hematopoietic stem cells but also
                 the survival of lethally irradiated mice transplanted with
                 very low numbers of such cells. The second is the use of a
                 limiting-dilution experimental design to allow stem cell
                 quantitation. The assay involves transplanting limiting
                 numbers of male ``test'' cells into lethally irradiated
                 syngeneic female recipients together with 1-2 x 10(5)
                 syngeneic female marrow cells whose long-term repopulating
                 ability has been compromised by two previous cycles of marrow
                 transplantation. The proportion of assay recipients whose
                 regenerated hematopoietic tissues are determined to contain
                 greater than or equal to 5\% cells of test cell origin (male)
                 greater than or equal to 5 weeks later is then used to
                 calculate the frequency of competitive repopulating units
                 (CRU) in the original male test cell suspension (based on
                 Poisson statistics). Investigation of this assay system has
                 shown that all three potential sources of stem cells (test
                 cells, compromised cells, and the host) can under appropriate
                 circumstances contribute to long-term hematopoietic
                 regeneration, thus establishing both the competitive pressure
                 of hematopoietic stem cells in the cotransplanted compromised
                 population and in the host, and the need to use genetic
                 markers to track the specific contribution of the injected
                 test cells. Analysis of the frequency of CRU in test marrow
                 suspensions that varied widely in their CRU content gave
                 similar values when endpoints of either 5 or 10 weeks
                 posttransplantation were used and when either recipient marrow
                 or thymus was used to identify progeny populations. In
                 addition, repopulation of marrow and thymus was found to be
                 associated in most mice injected with limiting numbers of test
                 cells. These findings are consistent with the conclusion that
                 the assay is highly selective for a very primitive,
                 totipotent, reconstituting hematopoietic stem cell and should
                 therefore be particularly useful in future gene

  abstract    = "For decades, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were thought to
                 be a homogeneous population of cells with flexible behavior.
                 Now a new picture has emerged: The HSC compartment consists of
                 several subpopulations of HSCs each with distinct,
                 preprogrammed differentiation and proliferation behaviors.
                 These programs are epigenetically fixed and are stably
                 bequeathed to all daughter HSCs on self-renewal. HSCs within
                 each subset are remarkably similar in their self- renewal and
                 differentiation behaviors, to the point where their life span
                 can be predicted with mathematical certainty. Three subsets
                 can be distinguished when HSCs are classified by their
                 differentiation capacity: myeloid-biased, balanced, and
                 lymphoid-biased HSCs. The relative number of the HSC subsets
                 is developmentally regulated. Lymphoid-biased HSCs are found
                 predominantly early in the life of an organism, whereas
                 myeloid-biased HSCs accumulate in aged mice and humans. Thus,
                 the discovery of distinct subpopulations of HSCs has led to a
                 new understanding of HCS aging. This finding has implications
                 for other aspects of HSC biology and applications in
                 re-generative medicine. The possibility that other adult
                 tissue stem cells show similar heterogeneity and mechanisms of

                 randomly regulated by intrinsic and environmental influences.
                 A direct corollary of these tenets is that self-renewal will
                 continuously generate functionally heterogeneous daughter
                 HSCs. Decisions about self-renewal versus commitment are made
                 by individual, single HSCs and, thus, require examination on
                 the clonal level. We followed the behavior of individual,
                 clonally derived HSCs through long-term, serial repopulation
                 experiments. These studies showed that daughter HSCs derived
                 from individual clones were remarkably similar to each other
                 in the extent and kinetics of repopulation. Moreover, daughter
                 HSCs within a clone showed equivalent contributions to the

                 followed because of the discovery of a new subset of HSCs that
                 gave rise stably to skewed ratios of myeloid and lymphoid
                 cells. Overall, the data argue that self-renewal does not
                 contribute to the heterogeneity of the adult HSC compartment.
                 Rather, all HSCs in a clone follow a predetermined fate,
                 consistent with the generation-age hypothesis. By extension,
                 this suggests that the self-renewal and differentiation

                 development. Transgenic mice containing the human beta-globin
                 locus, consisting of the linked embryonic (epsilon), fetal

                 quantification in cells of various tissues transduced with

  abstract      = "There are numerous characterizations of Shannon entropy and
                   Tsallis entropy as measures of information obeying certain
                   properties. Using work by Faddeev and Furuichi, we derive a
                   very simple characterization. Instead of focusing on the
                   entropy of a probability measure on a finite set, this
                   characterization focuses on the `information loss', or
                   change in entropy, associated with a measure-preserving
                   function. Information loss is a special case of conditional
                   entropy: namely, it is the entropy of a random variable
                   conditioned on some function of that variable. We show that
                   Shannon entropy gives the only concept of information loss
                   that is functorial, convex-linear and continuous. This
                   characterization naturally generalizes to Tsallis entropy as
                   well.",

                   algorithms to infer a set of $P$ unknown model parameters
                   from $N$ noisy measurements. What are fundamental limits on
                   the accuracy of parameter inference, given finite
                   signal-to-noise ratios, limited measurements, prior
                   information, and computational tractability requirements?
                   How can we combine prior information with measurements to
                   achieve these limits? Classical statistics gives incisive
                   answers to these questions as the measurement density
                   $\textbackslash{}alpha =
                   \textbackslash{}frac\{N\}\{P\}\textbackslash{}rightarrow
                   \textbackslash{}infty$. However, these classical results are
                   not relevant to modern high-dimensional inference problems,
                   which instead occur at finite $\textbackslash{}alpha$. We
                   formulate and analyze high-dimensional inference as a
                   problem in the statistical physics of quenched disorder. Our
                   analysis uncovers fundamental limits on the accuracy of
                   inference in high dimensions, and reveals that widely
                   cherished inference algorithms like maximum likelihood (ML)
                   and maximum-a posteriori (MAP) inference cannot achieve
                   these limits. We further find optimal, computationally
                   tractable algorithms that can achieve these limits.
                   Intriguingly, in high dimensions, these optimal algorithms
                   become computationally simpler than MAP and ML, while still
                   outperforming them. For example, such optimal algorithms can
                   lead to as much as a 20\% reduction in the amount of data to
                   achieve the same performance relative to MAP. Moreover, our
                   analysis reveals simple relations between optimal high
                   dimensional inference and low dimensional scalar Bayesian
                   inference, insights into the nature of generalization and

                 is driven by the action of a small number of multipotent
                 haematopoietic stem cells. Evidence supporting this view has
                 been largely acquired through the use of functional assays

                 also govern native non-transplant haematopoiesis is entirely
                 unclear. Here we have established a novel experimental model

                 haematopoiesis. In contrast to what occurs following
                 transplantation, steady-state blood production is maintained
                 by the successive recruitment of thousands of clones, each
                 with a minimal contribution to mature progeny. Our results
                 demonstrate that a large number of long-lived progenitors,
                 rather than classically defined haematopoietic stem cells, are
                 the main drivers of steady-state haematopoiesis during most of

  abstract    = "It is currently thought that life-long blood cell production
                 is driven by the action of a small number of multipotent
                 haematopoietic stem cells. Evidence supporting this view has
                 been largely acquired through the use of functional assays
                 involving transplantation. However, whether these mechanisms
                 also govern native non-transplant haematopoiesis is entirely
                 unclear. Here we have established a novel experimental model
                 in mice where cells can be uniquely and genetically labelled
                 in situ to address this question. Using this approach, we have
                 performed longitudinal analyses of clonal dynamics in adult
                 mice that reveal unprecedented features of native
                 haematopoiesis. In contrast to what occurs following
                 transplantation, steady-state blood production is maintained
                 by the successive recruitment of thousands of clones, each
                 with a minimal contribution to mature progeny. Our results
                 demonstrate that a large number of long-lived progenitors,
                 rather than classically defined haematopoietic stem cells, are
                 the main drivers of steady-state haematopoiesis during most of
                 adulthood. Our results also have implications for
                 understanding the cellular origin of haematopoietic disease.",

                 intensive curative treatment for high-risk malignancies, its
                 failure to prevent relapse leaves few options for successful
                 salvage treatment. While many patients have a high early
                 mortality from relapse, some respond and have sustained
                 remissions, and a minority has a second chance of cure with
                 appropriate therapy. The prognosis for relapsed hematological
                 malignancies after SCT depends on four factors: the time
                 elapsed from SCT to relapse (with relapses occurring within 6
                 months having the worst prognosis), the disease type (with
                 chronic leukemias and some lymphomas having a second
                 possibility of cure with further treatment), the disease
                 burden and site of relapse (with better treatment success if
                 disease is treated early), and the conditions of the first
                 transplant (with superior outcome for patients where there is

                 specificity of the antileukemia effect with targeted agents or

                 patients having been given high-dose chemotherapy (HD-CT) with

                 model of granulopoiesis. The model utilizes a
                 convection-reaction partial differential equation (PDE) with
                 feedback from a cytokine compartment on proliferation,
                 maturation, and mobilization of granulocytes from bone marrow
                 to blood. The observed number of CFU-GM cells in the

                 has revealed variations in repopulation characteristics.
                 However, it is unclear whether similar properties apply in
                 primates. Here, we examined this issue through tracking of
                 thousands of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs)
                 in rhesus macaques for up to 12 years. Approximately half of
                 the clones analyzed contributed to long-term repopulation
                 (over 3-10 years), arising in sequential groups and likely
                 representing self-renewing HSCs. The remainder contributed
                 primarily for the first year. The long-lived clones could be
                 further subdivided into functional groups contributing
                 primarily to myeloid, lymphoid, or both myeloid and lymphoid
                 lineages. Over time, the 4\%-10\% of clones with robust dual

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Early application of second-generation sequencing
                 technologies to transcript quantitation (RNA-seq) has hinted
                 at a vast mammalian transcriptome, including transcripts from
                 nearly all known genes, which might be fully measured only by
                 ultradeep sequencing. Subsequent studies suggested that
                 low-abundance transcripts might be the result of technical or
                 biological noise rather than active transcripts; moreover,
                 most RNA-seq experiments did not provide enough read depth to
                 generate high-confidence estimates of gene expression for
                 low-abundance transcripts. As a result, the community adopted
                 several heuristics for RNA-seq analysis, most notably an
                 arbitrary expression threshold of 0.3 - 1 FPKM for downstream
                 analysis. However, advances in RNA-seq library preparation,
                 sequencing technology, and informatic analysis have addressed
                 many of the systemic sources of uncertainty and undermined the
                 assumptions that drove the adoption of these heuristics. We
                 provide an updated view of the accuracy and efficiency of
                 RNA-seq experiments, using genomic data from large-scale
                 studies like the ENCODE project to provide orthogonal
                 information against which to validate our conclusions.
                 RESULTS: We show that a human cell's transcriptome can be
                 divided into active genes carrying out the work of the cell
                 and other genes that are likely the by-products of biological
                 or experimental noise. We use ENCODE data on chromatin state
                 to show that ultralow-expression genes are predominantly
                 associated with repressed chromatin; we provide a novel
                 normalization metric, zFPKM, that identifies the threshold
                 between active and background gene expression; and we show
                 that this threshold is robust to experimental and analytical
                 variations. CONCLUSIONS: The zFPKM normalization method
                 accurately separates the biologically relevant genes in a
                 cell, which are associated with active promoters, from the
                 ultralow-expression noisy genes that have repressed promoters.
                 A read depth of twenty to thirty million mapped reads allows
                 high-confidence quantitation of genes expressed at this
                 threshold, providing important guidance for the design of
                 RNA-seq studies of gene expression. Moreover, we offer an

                 retaining a potential for heightened recall of effector
                 functions. During acute viral infection or following

                 phenotypic and functional changes during differentiation to
                 the effector and memory phases of the immune response. The
                 changes in cell phenotype that accompany memory T-cell
                 differentiation are predominantly mediated through acquired
                 transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, in part achieved

                   which we call the Bernstein-Orlicz norm. This new norm
                   interpolates sub-Gaussian and sub-exponential tail behavior.
                   In particular, we show how this norm can be used to simplify
                   the derivation of deviation inequalities for suprema of
                   collections of random variables. Secondly, we introduce
                   chaining and generic chaining along a tree. These simplify
                   the well-known concepts of chaining and generic chaining.
                   The supremum of the empirical process is then studied as a
                   special case. We show that chaining along a tree can be done
                   using entropy with bracketing. Finally, we establish a

                   efficient truncation step embedded in the tensor power

                   dimensional Gaussian mixture and mixtures of sparse
                   regressions. A thorough theoretical investigation is further

                   statistical rate by introducing a proper initialization

                 d(k)u(k)v(k)(T), where d(k), u(k), and v(k) minimize the
                 squared Frobenius norm of X - circumflexX, subject to

                 interest is the use of L(1)-penalties on u(k) and v(k), which

               sum of the absolute values (L1-norm) of the coefficients. The
               form of this penalty encourages sparse solutions (with many
               coefficients equal to 0). We propose the ?fused lasso?, a
               generalization that is designed for problems with features that
               can be ordered in some meaningful way. The fused lasso penalizes
               the L1-norm of both the coefficients and their successive
               differences. Thus it encourages sparsity of the coefficients and
               also sparsity of their differences---i.e. local constancy of the
               coefficient profile. The fused lasso is especially useful when
               the number of features p is much greater than N, the sample
               size. The technique is also extended to the ?hinge? loss
               function that underlies the support vector classifier. We

               (factors) for accurate prediction in regression. Such a problem
               arises naturally in many practical situations with the
               multifactor analysis-of-variance problem as the most important
               and well-known example. Instead of selecting factors by stepwise
               backward elimination, we focus on the accuracy of estimation and
               consider extensions of the lasso, the LARS algorithm and the
               non-negative garrotte for factor selection. The lasso, the LARS
               algorithm and the non-negative garrotte are recently proposed
               regression methods that can be used to select individual
               variables. We study and propose efficient algorithms for the
               extensions of these methods for factor selection and show that

               subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients

                 process used to model the kinetics of feline hematopoietic
                 stem cells (HSCs) in continuous time. Because of the
                 experimental design and data collection scheme, the
                 inferential task presents numerous challenges. While the
                 hematopoietic process evolves in continuous time, the
                 observations are collected only at discrete irregular times
                 and are a probabilistic function of the state of the process.
                 In addition, the animals go through an experimental procedure
                 such that their reserve of HSCs is severely depleted at the
                 start of the observation period. This impedes any
                 approximation of the hematopoietic process with a continuous
                 state-space process (normal approximation of the transition
                 probabilities would be inaccurate when the state of the
                 process, i.e. the number of stem cells, is small). We
                 implement a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that allows us
                 to estimate the posterior distribution of the parameters of
                 the hematopoietic process while maintaining its state-space
                 discrete (i.e. without using any approximation). We show the

                 apply the algorithm to data on multiple experimental cats and
                 provide estimates of the rates of the fates of feline HSCs.
                 The obtained estimates are in agreement with the estimates
                 obtained with different methods published in the medical
                 literature. However, the proposed approach makes a more
                 efficient use of the data and hence the parameter estimates

                   the derivation of deviation inequalities for suprema of
                   collections of random variables. Secondly, we introduce
                   chaining and generic chaining along a tree. These simplify
                   the well-known concepts of chaining and generic chaining.
                   The supremum of the empirical process is then studied as a
                   special case. We show that chaining along a tree can be done
                   using entropy with bracketing. Finally, we establish a

                 antibody targets in the context of the recent HIV-1 envelope
                 trimer structure, describe new antibody isolation
                 technologies, and discuss the implications of these data for
                 HIV-1 prevention and therapy. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent advances
                 in B-cell technologies have dramatically expanded the number
                 of antibodies isolated from HIV-infected donors with broadly
                 neutralizing plasma activity. These, together with the first
                 high-resolution crystal and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)
                 structures of a cleaved, prefusion HIV-1 trimer, have defined
                 new regions susceptible to neutralization. This year, three
                 epitopes in the gp120-gp41 interface were structurally
                 characterized, highlighting the importance of prefusion gp41
                 as a target. Similar to many other broadly neutralizing
                 antibody epitopes, these new antibodies define a target that
                 is also highly glycan dependent. Collectively, the epitopes
                 for broadly neutralizing antibodies now reveal a continuum of
                 vulnerability spanning the length of the HIV-1 envelope
                 trimer. SUMMARY: Progress in the last year has provided
                 support for the use of rationally stabilized whole HIV-1
                 trimers as immunogens for eliciting antibodies to multiple
                 epitopes. Furthermore, the increasing number of broad and
                 potent antibodies with the potential for
                 synergistic/complementary combinations opens up new avenues
                 for preventing and treating HIV-1 infection.",

                 immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoires has been associated with
                 aging, disease susceptibility, and differential response to
                 infection and vaccination. Repertoire properties can now be
                 studied at large-scale through next-generation sequencing of
                 rearranged Ig genes. Accurate analysis of these
                 repertoire-sequencing (Rep-Seq) data requires identifying the
                 germline variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene
                 segments used by each Ig sequence. Current V(D)J assignment
                 methods work by aligning sequences to a database of known
                 germline V(D)J segment alleles. However, existing databases
                 are likely to be incomplete and novel polymorphisms are hard
                 to differentiate from the frequent occurrence of somatic
                 hypermutations in Ig sequences. Here we develop a Tool for Ig
                 Genotype Elucidation via Rep-Seq (TIgGER). TIgGER analyzes
                 mutation patterns in Rep-Seq data to identify novel V segment
                 alleles, and also constructs a personalized germline database
                 containing the specific set of alleles carried by a subject.
                 This information is then used to improve the initial V segment
                 assignments from existing tools, like IMGT/HighV-QUEST. The
                 application of TIgGER to Rep-Seq data from seven subjects
                 identified 11 novel V segment alleles, including at least one
                 in every subject examined. These novel alleles constituted
                 13\% of the total number of unique alleles in these subjects,
                 and impacted 3\% of V(D)J segment assignments. These results
                 reinforce the highly polymorphic nature of human Ig V genes,
                 and suggest that many novel alleles remain to be discovered.
                 The integration of TIgGER into Rep-Seq processing pipelines
                 will increase the accuracy of V segment assignments, thus
                 improving B-cell repertoire analyses.",

                 brings challenging issues in computational biology due to
                 their size and complexity. Here, we focus on a class of
                 multivariate statistical methods called partial least square
                 (PLS). Sparse version of PLS (sPLS) operates integration of
                 two datasets while simultaneously selecting the contributing
                 variables. However, these methods do not take into account the
                 important structural or group effects due to the relationship
                 between markers among biological pathways. Hence, considering
                 the predefined groups of markers (e.g. genesets), this could
                 improve the relevance and the efficacy of the PLS approach.
                 RESULTS: We propose two PLS extensions called group PLS (gPLS)
                 and sparse gPLS (sgPLS). Our algorithm enables to study the
                 relationship between two different types of omics data (e.g.
                 SNP and gene expression) or between an omics dataset and
                 multivariate phenotypes (e.g. cytokine secretion). We
                 demonstrate the good performance of gPLS and sgPLS compared
                 with the sPLS in the context of grouped data. Then, these
                 methods are compared through an HIV therapeutic vaccine trial.
                 Our approaches provide parsimonious models to reveal the
                 relationship between gene abundance and the immunological
                 response to the vaccine. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The

                 in HIV-infected patients is the mixed effects linear model.
                 However, longitudinal studies of viral load are complicated by
                 left censoring of the measures due to a lower quantification
                 limit. We propose a full likelihood approach to estimate
                 parameters from the linear mixed effects model for
                 left-censored Gaussian data. For each subject, the
                 contribution to the likelihood is the product of the density
                 for the vector of the completely observed outcome and of the
                 conditional distribution function of the vector of the
                 censored outcome, given the observed outcomes. Values of the
                 distribution function were computed by numerical integration.
                 The maximization is performed by a combination of the Simplex
                 algorithm and the Marquardt algorithm. Subject-specific
                 deviations and random effects are estimated by modified
                 empirical Bayes replacing censored measures by their
                 conditional expectations given the data. A simulation study
                 showed that the proposed estimators are less biased than those
                 obtained by imputing the quantification limit to censored
                 data. Moreover, for models with complex covariance structures,
                 they are less biased than Monte Carlo expectation maximization

                 difficult to estimate due to problems of synchronization,
                 temporal sampling and rate heterogeneity. Methods are needed
                 that can utilize multi-dimensional data, such as those
                 resulting from DNA microarray experiments, in order to
                 reconstruct time series from unordered or poorly ordered sets
                 of observations. RESULTS: We present a set of algorithms for
                 estimating temporal orderings from unordered sets of sample
                 elements. The techniques we describe are based on
                 modifications of a minimum-spanning tree calculated from a
                 weighted, undirected graph. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
                 approach by applying these techniques to an artificial data
                 set as well as several gene expression data sets derived from
                 DNA microarray experiments. In addition to estimating
                 orderings, the techniques we describe also provide useful
                 heuristics for assessing relevant properties of sample
                 datasets such as noise and sampling intensity, and we show how
                 a data structure called a PQ-tree can be used to represent

                 such as cell differentiation is challenging owing to the high
                 variability in gene expression between individual cells.
                 Time-series gene expression analyses of bulk cells have
                 difficulty distinguishing early and late phases of a
                 transcriptional cascade or identifying rare subpopulations of
                 cells, and single-cell proteomic methods rely on a priori
                 knowledge of key distinguishing markers. Here we describe
                 Monocle, an unsupervised algorithm that increases the temporal
                 resolution of transcriptome dynamics using single-cell RNA-Seq
                 data collected at multiple time points. Applied to the
                 differentiation of primary human myoblasts, Monocle revealed
                 switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors,
                 sequential waves of gene regulation, and expression of
                 regulators that were not known to act in differentiation. We
                 validated some of these predicted regulators in a loss-of
                 function screen. Monocle can in principle be used to recover
                 single-cell gene expression kinetics from a wide array of
                 cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation

                 individual cells exist in biochemical states that define
                 functional differences between them. New technology based on
                 microfluidic arrays combined with multiplexed quantitative
                 polymerase chain reactions now enables high-throughput
                 single-cell gene expression measurement, allowing assessment
                 of cellular heterogeneity. However, few analytic tools have
                 been developed specifically for the statistical and analytical
                 challenges of single-cell quantitative polymerase chain
                 reactions data. RESULTS: We present a statistical framework
                 for the exploration, quality control and analysis of
                 single-cell gene expression data from microfluidic arrays. We
                 assess accuracy and within-sample heterogeneity of single-cell
                 expression and develop quality control criteria to filter
                 unreliable cell measurements. We propose a statistical model
                 accounting for the fact that genes at the single-cell level
                 can be on (and a continuous expression measure is recorded) or
                 dichotomously off (and the recorded expression is zero). Based
                 on this model, we derive a combined likelihood ratio test for
                 differential expression that incorporates both the discrete
                 and continuous components. Using an experiment that examines
                 treatment-specific changes in expression, we show that this
                 combined test is more powerful than either the continuous or
                 dichotomous component in isolation, or a t-test on the
                 zero-inflated data. Although developed for measurements from a
                 specific platform (Fluidigm), these tools are generalizable to
                 other multi-parametric measures over large numbers of events.

               a multivariate normal distribution corresponds to conditional
               independence restrictions between variables. Covariance
               selection aims at estimating those structural zeros from data.
               We show that neighborhood selection with the Lasso is a
               computationally attractive alternative to standard covariance
               selection for sparse high-dimensional graphs. Neighborhood

  abstract    = "Advances in high-throughput, single cell gene expression are
                 allowing interrogation of cell heterogeneity. However, there
                 is concern that the cell cycle phase of a cell might bias
                 characterizations of gene expression at the single-cell level.
                 We assess the effect of cell cycle phase on gene expression in
                 single cells by measuring 333 genes in 930 cells across three
                 phases and three cell lines. We determine each cell's phase
                 non-invasively without chemical arrest and use it as a
                 covariate in tests of differential expression. We observe
                 bi-modal gene expression, a previously-described phenomenon,
                 wherein the expression of otherwise abundant genes is either
                 strongly positive, or undetectable within individual cells.
                 This bi-modality is likely both biologically and technically
                 driven. Irrespective of its source, we show that it should be
                 modeled to draw accurate inferences from single cell
                 expression experiments. To this end, we propose a
                 semi-continuous modeling framework based on the generalized
                 linear model, and use it to characterize genes with consistent
                 cell cycle effects across three cell lines. Our new
                 computational framework improves the detection of previously
                 characterized cell-cycle genes compared to approaches that do
                 not account for the bi-modality of single-cell data. We use
                 our semi-continuous modelling framework to estimate single
                 cell gene co-expression networks. These networks suggest that
                 in addition to having phase-dependent shifts in expression
                 (when averaged over many cells), some, but not all, canonical
                 cell cycle genes tend to be co-expressed in groups in single
                 cells. We estimate the amount of single cell expression
                 variability attributable to the cell cycle. We find that the
                 cell cycle explains only 5\%-17\% of expression variability,
                 suggesting that the cell cycle will not tend to be a large
                 nuisance factor in analysis of the single cell transcriptome.",

                 have enabled high-dimensional, high-throughput measurements of
                 individual cells as well as the interrogation of cell
                 population heterogeneity. However, in many instances,
                 computational tools to analyze the wealth of data generated by
                 these technologies are lacking. Here, we present a
                 computational framework for unbiased combinatorial
                 polyfunctionality analysis of antigen-specific T-cell subsets
                 (COMPASS). COMPASS uses a Bayesian hierarchical framework to
                 model all observed cell subsets and select those most likely
                 to have antigen-specific responses. Cell-subset responses are
                 quantified by posterior probabilities, and human subject-level
                 responses are quantified by two summary statistics that
                 describe the quality of an individual's polyfunctional
                 response and can be correlated directly with clinical outcome.
                 Using three clinical data sets of cytokine production, we
                 demonstrate how COMPASS improves characterization of
                 antigen-specific T cells and reveals cellular 'correlates of
                 protection/immunity' in the RV144 HIV vaccine efficacy trial
                 that are missed by other methods. COMPASS is available as

                 potential in humans of T cell subpopulations is of paramount
                 importance for the development of effective T cell therapies.
                 In particular, uncovering the dynamics in vivo in humans of
                 the recently described T memory stem cells (TSCM) would be
                 crucial for therapeutic approaches that aim at taking
                 advantage of a stable cellular vehicle with precursor
                 potential. We exploited data derived from two gene therapy
                 clinical trials for an inherited immunodeficiency, using
                 either retrovirally engineered hematopoietic stem cells or
                 mature lymphocytes to trace individual T cell clones directly
                 in vivo in humans. We compared healthy donors and bone
                 marrow-transplanted patients, studied long-term in vivo T cell
                 composition under different clinical conditions, and
                 specifically examined TSCM contribution according to age,
                 conditioning regimen, disease background, cell source,
                 long-term reconstitution, and ex vivo gene correction
                 processing. High-throughput sequencing of retroviral vector
                 integration sites (ISs) allowed tracing the fate of more than
                 1700 individual T cell clones in gene therapy patients after
                 infusion of gene-corrected hematopoietic stem cells or mature
                 lymphocytes. We shed light on long-term in vivo clonal
                 relationships among different T cell subtypes, and we unveiled
                 that TSCM are able to persist and to preserve their precursor
                 potential in humans for up to 12 years after infusion of
                 gene-corrected lymphocytes. Overall, this work provides
                 high-resolution tracking of T cell fate and activity and
                 validates, in humans, the safe and functional decade-long

                   relationship between its prediction performance and the
                   correlations of the covariates is not fully understood. In
                   this paper, we give new insights into this relationship in
                   the context of multiple linear regression. We show, in
                   particular, that the incorporation of a simple correlation

                 from a seemingly homogenous population, individual cells can
                 exhibit substantial differences in gene expression, protein
                 levels and phenotypic output, with important functional
                 consequences. Existing studies of cellular heterogeneity,
                 however, have typically measured only a few pre-selected RNAs
                 or proteins simultaneously, because genomic profiling methods
                 could not be applied to single cells until very recently. Here
                 we use single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate heterogeneity
                 in the response of mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells
                 (BMDCs) to lipopolysaccharide. We find extensive, and
                 previously unobserved, bimodal variation in messenger RNA
                 abundance and splicing patterns, which we validate by
                 RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization for select transcripts.
                 In particular, hundreds of key immune genes are bimodally
                 expressed across cells, surprisingly even for genes that are
                 very highly expressed at the population average. Moreover,
                 splicing patterns demonstrate previously unobserved levels of
                 heterogeneity between cells. Some of the observed bimodality
                 can be attributed to closely related, yet distinct, known
                 maturity states of BMDCs; other portions reflect differences
                 in the usage of key regulatory circuits. For example, we
                 identify a module of 137 highly variable, yet co-regulated,
                 antiviral response genes. Using cells from knockout mice, we
                 show that variability in this module may be propagated through
                 an interferon feedback circuit, involving the transcriptional
                 regulators Stat2 and Irf7. Our study demonstrates the power
                 and promise of single-cell genomics in uncovering functional
                 diversity between cells and in deciphering cell states and
                 circuits.",

                   causal model and a non-causal model? Suppose we intervene on
                   the predictor variables or change the whole environment. The
                   predictions from a causal model will in general work as well
                   under interventions as for observational data. In contrast,
                   predictions from a non-causal model can potentially be very
                   wrong if we actively intervene on variables. Here, we
                   propose to exploit this invariance of a prediction under a
                   causal model for causal inference: given different
                   experimental settings (for example various interventions) we
                   collect all models that do show invariance in their
                   predictive accuracy across settings and interventions. The
                   causal model will be a member of this set of models with
                   high probability. This approach yields valid confidence
                   intervals for the causal relationships in quite general

                   identifiable. We further investigate robustness properties

                   possible extensions for these cases. The empirical

  abstract    = "Cells, the basic units of biological structure and function,
                 vary broadly in type and state. Single-cell genomics can
                 characterize cell identity and function, but limitations of
                 ease and scale have prevented its broad application. Here we
                 describe Drop-seq, a strategy for quickly profiling thousands
                 of individual cells by separating them into nanoliter-sized
                 aqueous droplets, associating a different barcode with each
                 cell's RNAs, and sequencing them all together. Drop-seq
                 analyzes mRNA transcripts from thousands of individual cells
                 simultaneously while remembering transcripts' cell of origin.
                 We analyzed transcriptomes from 44,808 mouse retinal cells and
                 identified 39 transcriptionally distinct cell populations,
                 creating a molecular atlas of gene expression for known
                 retinal cell classes and novel candidate cell subtypes.
                 Drop-seq will accelerate biological discovery by enabling
                 routine transcriptional profiling at single-cell resolution.
